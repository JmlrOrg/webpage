  <a class="anchor" name="Overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
  <a class="anchor" name="Scope"><h3>Scope</h3></a>
  JMLR seeks previously unpublished papers on machine learning that contain:
<ul>
  <li>
    new principled algorithms with sound empirical validation, and with
    justification of theoretical, psychological, or biological nature;
  </li>
  <li>
    experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight into the design
    and behavior of learning in intelligent systems;
  </li>
  <li>
    formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of new
    applications) and of methods for assessing performance on those tasks;
  </li>
  <li>
    development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical studies of
    practical learning methods.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
JMLR publishes papers on the theory and methods of machine learning but does not publish 
applications of machine learning to other domains. JMLR favors papers of interest to a broader 
machine learning audience and may deem a paper unsuitable if the editorial board finds its audience 
too narrow. JMLR occasionally publishes surveys by invitation from the editorial board; we do not 
consider unsolicited survey papers.
</p>
<p>
JMLR does not allow simultaneous submission to conferences or other journals.
</p>
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Content">Content</a>
  </h3>
  Papers must be concise and complete; manuscripts should be carefully proofread
  and polished. Submissions that do not meet these criteria may be returned
  unreviewed.
  <p>
    All claims should be clearly articulated and supported either by empirical
    experiments or theoretical analyses. When appropriate, authors are encouraged
    to implement their work and to demonstrate its utility on significant
    problems; any experiments reported should be reproducible. Papers describing
    systems should clearly describe the contributions or the principles underlying
    the system. Papers describing theoretical results should also discuss their
    practical utility. In general, it should be clear how the work advances the
    current state of understanding and why the advance matters. Papers should
    report on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Authors must clearly acknowledge the contributions of their predecessors, and
    situate their submission in the context of the broader machine learning
    research literature. If a paper introduces new terminology or techniques, it
    should also explain why current terminology or techniques are insufficient.
  </p>
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Originality">Originality</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Submissions to JMLR cannot have been published previously in any other
    journal. We will consider submissions that have been published at workshops or
    conferences. In these cases, we expect the JMLR submission to cite the prior
    work, go into much greater depth and to extend the published results in a
    substantive way. In all cases, authors must notify JMLR about previous
    publication at the time of submission, attach the previous paper as a
    supplementary document, and explain the differences from their prior work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of (possibly) acceptable 'deltas' beyond a conference paper include:
    new theoretical results, entirely new application domains, significant new
    insights and/or analyses. Examples of insufficient deltas include: adding
    proofs that were omitted from a conference paper; minor variations or
    extensions of previous experiments; adding extra background material or
    references. However, we ultimately leave the decision about whether a 'delta'
    is significant enough up to the individual reviewers.
  </p>
<p>Currently, JMLR does not publish review articles.</p>
<p> JMLR has a strict policy against plagiarism.

 When there is an accusation of plagiarism, JMLR takes the following steps.

<ul>
  <li> JMLR asks the accuser to clearly document the plagiarism.
  <li> JMLR sends the documentation to the accused authors for a response.
  <li> JMLR reviews the accusation and the response, possibly in
  consultation with other experts in the relevant fields, and makes a
  determination.
</ul>

<p> If JMLR determines that there has been plagiarism, the paper is
  retracted (or rejected, if it is a manuscript). JMLR may take
  additional steps, such as (but not necessarily limited to)
  contacting the program chairs of the major machine learning
  conferences, contacting the editors of other journals, contacting
  the places of employment of the accused authors, and rejecting other
  manuscripts under submission to JMLR by the same authors.
  <h3><a class="anchor" name="Preprints">Preprints</a></h3>
  <p>
    Authors may submit work to JMLR that is already available as a preprint, for
    example on arXiV or personal websites.
  </p>
  <h3><a class="anchor" name="Disclosure">Disclosure of Funding</a></h3>
  <p>
  Please identify any Funding and Conflicts of Interest that fall into the following categories:
  </p>
  <h4>Funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work):</h4>
  <p>In order to pursue the work that you submitted to JMLR, did any of the authors receive third party funding or third party support during the last 36 months prior to this submission? This question refers to any aspect of the submitted work, including but not limited to personal funding, data collection, data evaluation, computing hardware, cloud computing services, or programming support. Examples could be grants by a government agency, stipends or donations by a commercial sponsor, a private foundation or a charity.</p>
  <p>Please list all such funding sources.</p>
  <p>Example: Funding in direct support of this work: NSF grant XXX, GPUs donated by YYY, scholarship by Company ZZZ.</p>

  <h4>Competing Interests (financial activities outside the submitted work):</h4>
  <p>Did any of the authors have financial relationships with entities that could potentially be perceived to influence what you wrote in the submitted work, during the last 36 months prior to this submission? You should disclose interactions with any entity that could be considered broadly relevant to the work, even if the funding was not used to support the submitted work, and regardless of the amount of compensation. Examples could be engagements with commercial companies or startups (sabbaticals, employments, stipends), honorariums, donations of hardware or cloud computing services.</p>
  <p>Please list all sources of revenue paid or promised to be paid.</p>
  <p>Example: Additional revenues related to this work: Sabbatical at Company Y; Part time employment with Company Z; Honorarium for lectures by Charity X; Honorarium as Member of the Advisory Board of Startup C; Travel support by Foundation A; hardware donations by Company B.</p>
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Submission">Submission procedure</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    JMLR accepts submissions via its own
    <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb/" target="_blank"
    >electronic submission management system</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Submissions must be typeset in LaTex using the
    <a href="https://github.com/JmlrOrg/jmlr-style-file">JMLR LaTeX style file</a>
    described in the
    <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/format/authors-guide.html"> authors guide</a>.
    Only PDF files should be submitted. Papers not in the JMLR style file will be
    rejected without review
  </p>
  <p>
    Articles may be accompanied by online appendices containing data,
    demonstrations, instructions for obtaining source code, or the source code
    itself&nbsp; if appropriate. We strongly encourage authors to include such
    appendices along with their papers. (Note: if an online appendix contains
    source code, we will require you to sign a release form prior to publication
    freeing us from liability.) We also strongly encourage authors to submit their
    data sets to the
    <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Papers longer than 35 pages will take a longer time to review and may be rejected if an AE and reviewers cannot be found. Further, papers above 50 pages require a note of justification in the cover letter, and may be desk rejected.  (Note that these page counts include appendices.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Articles must be accompanied by a cover letter (in PDF, using
    <a href="https://github.com/JmlrOrg/jmlr-coverletter/releases/tag/v1.0"
    >this LaTeX template</a
    >
    or plain text format) containing all of the below:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Disclosure of any previous publications by the author(s) that significantly
      overlap with the submission. E.g., if the submission is an extended version
      of an earlier conference paper, please described the differences between the
      two papers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirmation that all co-authors are aware of the current submission and
      consent to its review by JMLR.
    </li>
    <li>
      Declaration of possible conflicts of interest; in particular, name all
      action editors that have recently collaborated with authors of the
      submission.
    </li>
    <li>
      Suggestions of 3 to 5
      <a href="http://jmlr.org/editorial-board.html">action editors</a> that seem
      best suited to handle the submitted manuscript (Note: from the list of Action Editors, NOT editorial board reviewers). These suggestions will be
      considered (though not necessarily honored). We have found that some action
      editors are popular with many authors, and may be busy handling other papers
      at a given point in time, so listing at least three action editors helps us
      expedite the process. Please make sure no author has a
      conflict of interest (COI) with the AEs you suggest. See below
  for our critiria about a COI.
    </li>
    <li>
      Suggestions of 3 to 5 reviewers. These suggestions will be considered
      (though, again, not necessarily taken) by the action editor. As a reminder,
      do not suggest reviewers for whom there is a conflict of interest. As one
      example, an advisee / advisor relationship is a lifelong conflict of
      interest.
    </li>
    <li>List of keywords from the article.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To submit a paper, please</p>

  <h3> Authorship Changes </h3>
  <p>
  The list of authors provided at initial submission is deemed final
  for the duration of peer review.  Requests to add, remove, or
  reorder authors are not permitted during this period, except in
  rare, well-justified circumstances (e.g., administrative error,
  authorship dispute resolution).  If an exceptional situation arises,
  the corresponding author must email the Editorial Office before a
  final decision is rendered, supplying (i) a detailed rationale, and
  (ii) written consent from all current and proposed authors.
  Approval is at the sole discretion of the Editor-in-Chiefs.
  <p>
  <h3> Conflicts of Interest </h3>

  <p> The following constitutes an individual conflict (adapted from the NeurIPS guidelines):
  <ul>
    <li> family or close friend
    <li> graduate advisee/advisor
    <li> any other collaboration in the past three years
    <li> any other reason that you might feel a conflict
  </ul>
  
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Reviewing">Reviewing</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    JMLR has a commitment to a rigorous review process, outlined below. After
    initially submitting a paper, a chief editor will screen it and,
  if suitable, assign an action editor.  The AE will then pick 3 reviewers to review
    your paper. Once the reviews are submitted, the AE makes the final
  decision. Note that some papers may take a long time to review (e.g., if they are especially long or complex, or are received during
    the review period of a major conference, or if all suitable action editors are
    overloaded), and a few papers may take less time (e.g., if they are rejected
    without review). The detailed steps are outlined below.
  </p>
  <h4>The JMLR Paper Review Process</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      When a paper is submitted to JMLR, it is scanned by the Editor-in-Chief
      (EIC). If the EIC finds that the paper is very clearly below the standards
      of the journal, or not in its scope, of if there are no suitable action
      editors, then the paper can be rejected without written review.
    </li>
    <li>
      The EIC assigns the paper to an action editor (AE) who has expertise in the
      area of the paper. If the AE finds that the paper is very likely to be
      rejected on full review, the AE will write a single short review explaining
      that position, and the paper will be rejected.
    </li>
    <li>
      The AE assigns the paper to three reviewers. The reviewers write detailed
      technical reviews of the paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      If only one review arrives in reasonable time, and that review is detailed
      and of high quality, and recommends rejection, and the AE agrees with the
      review, then the AE may decide to reject the paper based on the single
      review. If two reviews come in, and the decision is clear to the AE, the
      paper may be accepted or rejected. Or, the AE may decide to wait for the
      third review or even comission additional reviews, until the decision is
      clear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <!--Possible decisions are Accept and Reject. Accepted papers may still require minor revisions, but they need not be reviewed further. -->
      Possible decisions are Accept and Reject. Accepted papers may still require
      minor revisions, but those are usually checked only by the action editor.
      Rejection may or may not be accompanied by the encouragement to resubmit.
      Papers that are rejected will fall into two categories: those that are
      permitted to be resubmitted and those that are not. Authors should obtain
      explicit permission from an action editor before resubmitting a paper; to
      avoid misunderstandings, please contact the action editor or editor-in-chief
      if there is any ambiguity in the decision-making progress. Permission for
      resubmission should not be interpreted as any sort of guarantee of
      acceptance upon resubmission.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Publication">Publication</a>
  </h3>
  <!--When a paper is accepted, authors retain ownership of the copyright, but must
  sign a copyright agreement form giving MIT Press the right to publish the paper.-->
  When a paper is accepted, authors must sign an agreement granting a CC-by
  license to the public, which allows for publication in JMLR online by JMLR, Inc.
  and in a print-archive edition by Microtome Publishing. The copyright remains
  with the author. Authors are encouraged to provide electronic forms of any
  applicable data sets or executable code. They are also encouraged to add links
  to the article and the JMLR site to their personal web pages; if the authors
  wish to create a page pointing to subsequent related research, JMLR will
  maintain a link from the original paper to this page. See the
  <a href="format/authors-guide.html">authors guide</a> for a detailed checklist
  of post-acceptance actions.
  <p>
    A quarterly paper volume will be published and sold to libraries and
    individuals.
