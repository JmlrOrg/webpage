<a class="anchor" NAME="Overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Scope"><h3>Scope</h3></a>
JMLR seeks previously unpublished papers on machine learning that contain:
<ul>
	<li>new principled algorithms with sound empirical validation, and with justification of theoretical, psychological, or biological nature;</li>
	<!--
<li>
new algorithms with empirical, theoretical, psychological, or biological
justification;</li>
-->

<li>
experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight into the design
and behavior of learning in intelligent systems;</li>

<li>
accounts of applications of existing techniques that shed light on the
strengths and weaknesses of the methods;</li>

<li>
formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of new applications)
and of methods for assessing performance on those tasks;</li>

<li>
development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical studies
of practical learning methods;</li>

<li>
computational models of data from natural learning systems at the behavioral
or neural level; or</li>

<li>
extremely well-written surveys of existing work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Content">Content</a></h3>
Papers must be concise and complete; manuscripts should be carefully proofread
and polished. Submissions that do not meet these criteria may be returned
unreviewed.
<p>All claims should be clearly articulated and supported either by empirical
experiments or theoretical analyses. When appropriate, authors are encouraged
to implement their work and to demonstrate its utility on significant problems;
any experiments reported should be reproducible. Papers describing systems
should clearly describe the contributions or the principles underlying
the system. Papers describing theoretical results should also discuss their
practical utility. In general, it should be clear how the work advances
the current state of understanding and why the advance matters. Papers
should report on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely
on what was done.
<p>Authors must clearly acknowledge the contributions of their predecessors.
If a paper introduces new terminology or techniques, it should also explain
why current terminology or techniques are insufficient.
<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Originality">Originality</a></h3>
<p>
Submissions to JMLR cannot have been published previously in any other journal.
We will consider submissions that have been published at workshops or
conferences.  In these cases, we expect the JMLR submission to cite the prior
work, go into much greater depth and to extend the published results in a
substantive way. In all cases, authors must notify JMLR about previous
publication at the time of submission, and explain the differences from their
prior work.</p>

<p>We will also consider concurrent submissions of papers that are under review
at conferences, provided the conference explicitly allows for this. In this
case, too, we expect that the difference between the papers satisfy the above
requirements, and we ask authors to provide their conference submission to the
JMLR action editor in charge of the JMLR submission.</p>

<p>
Examples of (possibly) acceptable 'deltas' beyond a conference paper include:
new theoretical results, entirely new application domains,  significant new
insights and/or analyses. Examples of insufficient deltas include: adding
proofs that were omitted from a conference paper; minor variations or
extensions of previous experiments; adding extra background material or
references. However, we ultimately leave the decision about whether a 'delta'
is significant enough up to the individual reviewers.</p>


<h3><a class="anchor" NAME="Preprints">Preprints</a></h3>

<p>Authors may submit work to JMLR that is already available as a preprint, for example on arXiV or personal websites.
</p>


<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Submission">Submission procedure</a></h3>
JMLR accepts submissions via its own <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb/" target=_blank>electronic submission management system</a>.<p>

Articles must be submitted in PDF format (other formats, such as PostScript, or Microsoft
Word, are NOT acceptable). Submissions should be in single column format, typeset in
11 point font or larger, and should include all author contact information
on the first page. Although not required for submission, we encourage authors
to use the JMLR LaTeX style files (described in the <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/format/authors-guide.html"> authors guide</a>).  To ease the workload for the managing editor,
all camera-ready copies of accepted papers are required to be typeset in LaTeX with these style files.

<p>Articles may be accompanied by online appendices containing data, demonstrations,
instructions for obtaining source code, or the source code itself&nbsp;
if appropriate. We strongly encourage authors to include such appendices
along with their papers. (Note: if an online appendix contains source code,
we will require you to sign a release form prior to publication freeing
us from liability.)
We also strongly encourage authors to submit their data sets to the
<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.

<p> Articles must be accompanied by a cover letter (in PDF or plain text format) containing all of the below:
<ol>
    <li> Disclosure of any previous publications by the author(s) that significantly overlap with the submission. E.g., if the submission is an extended version of an earlier conference paper, please described the differences between the two papers. Simultaneous submission of papers to JMLR and other venues is not allowed.</li>
    <li> Confirmation that all co-authors are aware of the current submission and consent to its review by JMLR.</li>
    <li> Declaration of possible conflicts of interest; in particular, name all action editors that have recently collaborated with authors of the submission.</li>
    <!--<li> Suggestions of <a href="http://jmlr.org/editorial-board.html">action editors</a> that seem best suited to handle the submitted manuscript. These suggestions will be considered (though not necessarily honored). We have found that some action editors are popular with many authors, and may be busy handling other papers at a given point in time, so listing at least three action editors helps us expedite the process.</li>-->
    <li>Suggestions of at least three <a href="http://jmlr.org/editorial-board.html">action editors</a> that seem best suited to handle the submitted manuscript. These suggestions will be considered (though not necessarily honored). We have found that some action editors are popular with many authors, and may be busy handling other papers at a given point in time, so listing at least three action editors helps us expedite the process.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>To submit a paper, please</p>

<ol>
 <li>Prepare it in PDF format (if the submission
     contains multiple files, please create an archive in tar or zip format). </li>
<li>Prepare the cover letter as described above in another PDF or plain text file.</li>
 <li>Ensure
     that the file to be uploaded is less than 5Mb in size.</li>
 <li>Ensure
     that the title page contains</li>
 <ul>
  <li>complete
      name, post and e-mail address of the corresponding author;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>a
      condensed running title of fifty (50) characters or less</li>
  <li>a
      list of five key-words</li>
  <li>an
      abstract that does not exceed 200 words</li>
 </u>
 <li>Go to <a
     href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb" target=_blank>http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/manudb</a>,
     register and log in.</li>
 <li>Select the "submit manuscript" link across the top and upload your manuscript into the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can then confirm that your manuscript has been received by selecting (at the top of the page) "manuscript listing" followed by "author."  Your manuscript's ID tag should appear along the left-hand side.  Following its link will give the current status of the manuscript.</p>

<h3>
<a name="Reviewing">Reviewing</a></h3>
<p>JMLR has a commitment to a rigorous review process, outlined below.
Due to an ever increasing number of submissions, our timeline is as follows.
After initially submitting a paper, an action editor will be assigned within
about one month. The AE will then pick 3 reviewers who may take 1-3 months to
review your paper. The AE makes the final decision, which will usually be
available within 4-6 months after initial submission.  However, some papers may
take longer (e.g., if they are especially long or complex, or are received
during the review period of a major conference, or if all suitable action
editors are overloaded), and a few papers may take less time (e.g., if they are
rejected without review). The detailed steps are outlined below.</p>


<h4>The JMLR Paper Review Process</h4>
<ol>
<li> When a paper is submitted to JMLR, it is scanned by the Editor-in-Chief (EIC). If the EIC finds that the paper is very clearly below the standards of the journal, or not in its scope, of if there are no suitable action editors, then the paper can be rejected without written review.

<li>  The EIC assigns the paper to an action editor (AE) who has expertise
in the area of the paper.  If the AE finds that the paper is very
likely to be rejected on full review, the AE will write a single short
review explaining that position, and the paper will be rejected.

<li> The AE assigns the paper to three reviewers.  The reviewers write
detailed technical reviews of the paper.

<li> If only one review arrives in reasonable time, and that review is
detailed and of high quality, and recommends rejection, and the AE
agrees with the review, then the AE may decide to reject the paper
based on the single review.  If two reviews come in, and the decision
is clear to the AE, the paper may be accepted or rejected.  Or, the AE
may decide to wait for the third review or even comission additional
reviews, until the decision is clear.

<li>
<!--Possible decisions are Accept and Reject. Accepted papers may still require minor revisions, but they need not be reviewed further. -->
Possible decisions are Accept and Reject. Accepted papers may still require minor revisions, but those are usually checked only by the action editor. Rejection may or may not be accompanied by the encouragement to resubmit.
Papers that are rejected will fall into two categories: those that are permitted to be resubmitted and those that are not.  Authors should obtain explicit permission from an action editor before resubmitting a paper; to avoid misunderstandings, please contact the action editor or editor-in-chief if there is any ambiguity in the decision-making progress.  Permission for resubmission should not be interpreted as any sort of guarantee of acceptance upon resubmission.
</ol>

<!--
<p>JMLR reviewers are instructed to make recommendations to accept
or reject. If
a paper requires substantial revisions, it will not be accepted. In this
case, the editor may recommend that the author submit a revised version,
but there is no guarantee it will be reviewed by the same referees, or
that it will eventually be published. A paper may be revised and resubmitted
at most once. To avoid misunderstandings about interpretation of reviewer
and editor recommendations, we encourage authors to contact the editor
prior to resubmission with any salient questions.
<p>If a paper is accepted, the editor and reviewers may require minor revisions.
The author should return the revised paper as soon as possible. Normally,
authors will have up to three months to accomplish their revisions. Upon
receiving a revised paper the editor may, at their discretion, ask the
reviewers to re-review the revised paper. Electronic publication will occur
immediately upon receipt of the final version of an accepted article.
-->


<h3>
<a class="anchor" NAME="Publication">Publication</a></h3>
<!--When a paper is accepted, authors retain ownership of the copyright, but must
sign a copyright agreement form giving MIT Press the right to publish the paper.-->
When a paper is accepted, authors must sign an agreement granting a CC-by license to
the public, which allows for publication in JMLR online by JMLR, Inc. and in a
print-archive edition by Microtome Publishing. The copyright remains with the author.
Authors are encouraged to provide electronic forms of any applicable data sets
or executable code.  They are also encouraged to add links
to the article and the JMLR site to their personal web pages; if the authors
wish to create a page pointing to subsequent related research, JMLR will
maintain a link from the original paper to this page. See the <a href="format/authors-guide.html">authors
guide</a> for a detailed checklist of post-acceptance actions.
<p>A quarterly paper volume will be published and sold to libraries and individuals.
<p>Papers that fall in the area of support vector machines and kernel methods
will be considered for joint publication in JMLR and on <a
href="http://www.kernel-machines.org" target=_blank>www.kernel-machines.org</a>.
If appropriate, please indicate in your cover letter that you would like
your submission to be considered for inclusion in the kernel section. Further
information can be found in the <a
href="http://www.kernel-machines.org/jmlr" target=_blank>JMLR
section of the kernel machines web repository</a>.


<h2><a class="anchor" NAME="Special">Special Topics</a></h2>
JMLR is interested in publishing special issues, because it is often
useful to have a collection of strong papers on a single topic
collected together in an accessible way, and because the deadlines of
special issues are often a useful forcing function for people to
finally write up their journal papers.
<p>

Regular special issues, in which papers appear contiguously in the
printed version, have proved to be a major logistical nightmare,
largely because we have to wait until the last final version is
submitted before we can publish any of them.  There are also some
packing problems associated with trying to get all the papers of a
special issue into a single physical volume.

<p>
For these reasons, we have decided, in future, to have <b>special
    topics</b> instead of special issues.  These will operate in
    essentially the same mode as special issues, except that they
    papers will not appear contiguously in print.  They will be
    be published individually as soon as the first one is ready, and
    will be incrementally collected into a special page on the web
    site.

<h3> Proposing a Special Topic</h3>

If you'd like to propose a special topic, please submit a short
proposal outlining:
<ul>
<li> Topic area and why it is important
<li> Guest editors' expertise in the technical area, and with
  reviewing and editing
<li> Plan for circulating the call for papers
<li> Dates for submission, accept/reject decisions, and final versions
<li> Desired number of pages
</ul>

The action editors will discuss and make accept/reject decisions on
proposals.

<h3>Caveats</h3>
Here are some things we have observed about special issues, which are
useful to keep in mind.
<p>
Special issues tend to have somewhat lower quality papers than regular issues.
This may be because: it's a somewhat more closed community that is
reviewing and making decisions; or that papers are often invited by the
guest editors, who then find it difficult to reject marginal ones.
In any case, it's important to be aware of this phenomenon and try to
keep it in check.
<p>
Special issues almost always run late.  Sometimes very drastically
so.  Guest editors almost always underestimate the amount of work
required to manage the issue and the difficulty of extracting reviews
from even the best-intentioned of their colleagues.
